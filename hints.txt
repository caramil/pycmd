GIT SETUP HINTS by Adnan



#Enable ssh+git

1. Generate an SSH key
Open terminal to create ssh keys:

cd ~                 #Your home directory
ssh-keygen -t rsa    #Press enter for all values

2. Associate the SSH key with the remote repository

    If it is a GitHub repository and you have administrative privileges, go to settings and click 'add SSH key'. Copy the contents of your ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub into the field labeled 'Key'.

3. Set your remote URL to a form that supports SSH 1

If you have done the steps above and are still getting the password prompt, make sure your repo URL is in the form

git+ssh://git@github.com/username/reponame.git


4. Testing your SSH connection

    Open Terminal.

    Enter the following:

    ssh -T git@github.com

    # Attempts to ssh to GitHub

    You may see one of these warnings:

    The authenticity of host 'github.com (IP ADDRESS)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is 16:27:ac:a5:76:28:2d:36:63:1b:56:4d:eb:df:a6:48.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?


    Verify that the fingerprint in the message you see matches one of the messages in step 2, then type yes:

# Enable Origin Master as default


git branch --set-upstream-to origin/master
